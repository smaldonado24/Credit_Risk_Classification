## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of the analysis is to see if I can train a Machine Learning Model from a dataset to predict if several loans are healthy or high-risk.
* The data that was given was from information such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income.
* Based on the provided data points, I began by creating a label variable for the loan status column to serve as a comparison data point in the regression model. The remaining data was then divided into feature variables, which would be use to predict the loan

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * The Accuracy score results were 100% predicting a precision of 85% and the recall score has a weighted average of 99%

## Summary

* If we were to use this model to predict healthy loans, it would serve as a stron foundation for data analysis. However, for high-risk loans, additional data or an alternative dataset might be nessessary to improve overall accuracy.
